VIDEO RENTAL INVENTORY SYSTEM - QUESTION

The goal of this project is to design and implement a simple inventory control system 
for a small video rental store.

The following are the various classes that are to be implemented.

1. Video
    Member variables
        - String videoName
        - boolean checkout
        - int rating
    Member functions
        - String getName();
        - void doCheckout();
        - void doReturn();
        - void receiveRating(int rating);
        - int getRating();
        - boolean getCheckout();
    Constructors
        - Video(String name)

2. VideoStore
    Member variables
        - Video[] store;
    Member functions
        - void addVideo(String name);
        - void doCheckout(String name);
        - void doReturn(String name);
        - void receiveRating(String name, int rating);
        - void listInventory();

3. VideoLaucher
    - Contains the main method to test the program

DISCUSSION:
    . Would a member variable named "VideolD" been useful in this class design?
    . If yes, what ideas could be used for auto-generating the "VideolD"?
    . What other changes in the above features could have made the user-experience better?
